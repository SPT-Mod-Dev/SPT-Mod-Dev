SPT_JAP_eco_pressure:0 "The Pressure of Control"
SPT_JAP_eco_pressure_desc:0 "Following the Great War our economy has gone through a series of growth spurts and recessions that has created an unstable and uncertain model. The invisible hand of the free market has done little to help steer us into a desireable position in the global stage and it is becoming increasingly obvious to our greatest economists that this situation can not continue. Western writters have debated for the better part of a century how to truly break the chains of this model and achieve a truly efficient economy, and the recent experiment that is the Soviet economy and our manchurian puppet have given us a glimpse into what could be. To be independent and safe we must control the economy and adjust it to our needs."
