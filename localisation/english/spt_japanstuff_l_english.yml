spt_jap.1.desc:0 "The border between Manchuria and China has been a complex issue since our conquest during the Sino-Japanese War solidified our hold in mainland Asia. Per the terms of the Boxer Protocol we've been allowed to station troops at key points along the railways from Beijin to Tianjin, with minimal chinese oversight, leading to our presence being a constant thorn on their side. The army stationed there has never been easy to control and it is eager to fight another war even against the wishes of the civilian government in Tokyo. It is clear these escalations have only intensified and will require more careful maneuvering to impose our wishes on these border patrols."
