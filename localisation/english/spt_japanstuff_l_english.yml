SPT_JAP_Marco_Polo_desc:0 "Since the end of the Sino-Japanese War the border between our new possessions and China has been unstable. On our side, the Kwantung Army seems intent on starting another conflict, and on the chinese side the nationalists are waiting for an oportunity to retake the land we rightfully conquered. It may be impossible, but we should attempt to hold back until we can normalize relations or the right time to strike at China presents itself."
