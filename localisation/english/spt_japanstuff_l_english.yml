#DECISIONS

SPT_JAP_eco_pressure:0 "Growing Economic Bubble"
SPT_JAP_eco_pressure_desc:0 "Following the Great War our economy has gone through a series of growth spurts and recessions that has created an unstable and uncertain model. The invisible hand of the free market has done little to help steer us into a desireable position in the global stage and it is becoming increasingly obvious to our greatest economists that this situation can not continue. Western writters have debated for the better part of a century how to truly break the chains of this model and achieve a truly efficient economy, and the recent experiment that is the Soviet economy and our manchurian puppet have given us a glimpse into what could be. To be independent and safe we must control the economy and adjust it to our needs."

SPT_JAP_korea_dev:0 "The Korean Project"
SPT_JAP_korea_dev_desc:0 "Korea has been under our control for a few decades now and it continues to lag behind due to previous governments ignoring it in favor of our other territories.

#EVENTS

spt_jap.3.t:0 "German Production Engineers Inspect Our Methods"
spt_jap.3.desc:0 "The german engineers have concluded their inspections and have reported back to us a dreadful truth: our methods are practically ancient and full of inneficiencies compared to Western ones. This report sheds a light into our nation that is shameful. Should we really heed advice so negative and risk losing respect with our workers, or should we maintain our methods and find our own way of doing things?"
spt_jap.3.a:0 "Western advice only works in western factories, keep the japanese model!"

spt_jap_news.1.d:0 "On the 26th of February a number of junior officers and soldiers under their command attempted to assassinate the vast majority of the current administration of Japan. Claiming to be doing so in an effort to bring forth a wave of reforms and societal changes that would propel the nation into a glorious future. Their attempt was thwarted when Emperor Hirohito ordered the rebels to stand down and for the army to march into Tokyo to restore order. The surviving rebels were given swift and harsh punishments, alongside members of the military and civilians suspected of harboring sympathies and having helped the radicalize the junior officers. \n If this has been a shift in the political landscape of Japan towards a less militaristic stance remains to be seen, but it is clear that the current state of affairs within the nation is unpredictable."
spt_jap_news.1.a:0 "These are dark times."
spt_jap_news.1.b:0 "There's unrest in the East."
spt_jap_news.2.t:0 "The February 26th Revolution"

Despite Emperor Hirohito protesting the actions and montioning in favor of stopping the rebelion, the Army refused to stop the insurrection, resulting in the success of the rebels.\n Now under the management of a new and radical interim government, Japan seems to be moving rapidly towards expanding its influence over East Asia. Rethoric of a new Empire and of rejection of Western influences have been a key part of this new government's speeches to foreign powers."
spt_jap_news.2.a:0 "A dark sun rises."
spt_jap_news.2.b:0 "Our victory is certain!"

#FOCUSES

SPT_JAP_marco_polo_desc:0 "[Root.GetNameDefCap] is poor in resources, but our neighbours are not. We must take from them what we lack, and only require an excuse to begin doing so.

SPT_JAP_manchu_advisors_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to control our colony it is clear that the cutthroat and highly corrupt state of manchurian politics makes them incredibly difficult to deal with, but it also is a tool to train and perfect the best fifth-collumnists we could ever hope for."
SPT_JAP_learn_from_japan:0 "Learning From Our Past Wars"

SPT_JAP_learn_from_italy:0 "Learning From Italy"
SPT_JAP_learn_from_italy_desc:0 "We were allies during the Great War and we witnessed the ferocity and determination of the italian soldiers in Isonzo, we should approach them to better understand what makes their soldiers so capable."
SPT_JAP_italian_advisors:0 "Italian Advisors"
SPT_JAP_italian_advisors_desc:0 "Italy's use of infatry is not too dissimilar from our own, but their unique terrain considerations can give us insights we might never have thought of ourselves."

SPT_JAP_zaibatsu_in_gov:0 "Allow The Zaibatsu to Help"
SPT_JAP_zaibatsu_in_gov_desc:0 "Our goal for the future of our economy is complete government control, but as of right now it is in a half-way state that is undesirable to both our politicians and our businessmen.

SPT_JAP_konoe_government:0 "The Konoe Government"
SPT_JAP_konoe_government_desc:0 "The japanese administration has largely been a messy affair for the last few years, swapping prime ministers at absurd rate.

SPT_JAP_work_for_the_emperor:0 "Work For The Emperor"
SPT_JAP_work_for_the_emperor_desc:0 "The greatest joy our people should feel is the satisfaction of having worked to propell our great nation forward. Every strike of the hammer shall strike down the Emperor's enemies!"

SPT_JAP_zaibatsu_takeover_desc:0 "In an attempt to steer the Zaibatsu towards a common goal we gave them far too many connections and opportunities to bribe and threaten members of our government. Now it is clear why they were so agreeable when we first approached the conglomerates, they wanted full control of the state."
SPT_JAP_korean_project:0 "The Korean Project"
SPT_JAP_korean_project_desc:0 "The Korean Peninsula has a wealth of minerals, lands, and people that our Empire has only recently began taking advantage of.

SPT_JAP_invite_german_experts:0 "Invite German Experts"
SPT_JAP_invite_german_experts_desc:0 "Despite the leaps we've made in the last 50 years in adopting foreign ideas and developing our own it is clear that Japan lacks engineers experienced and innovative in the field of production.

SPT_JAP_eastern_ideas:0 "Develop Our Own Methods"
SPT_JAP_eastern_ideas_desc:0 "Not adopting the German methods of production does not mean we should stagnate, we should fund research into improvements that we can make within our systems."
SPT_JAP_western_ideas:0 "German Technological Exchange"
SPT_JAP_western_ideas_desc:0 "It is clear that the Germans have advanced considerably in the production of new and improved armaments, it would be foolish to not press our recent connections further and engage in some technological exchanges."
