#DECISIONS

SPT_JAP_eco_pressure:0 "Growing Economic Bubble"
SPT_JAP_eco_pressure_desc:0 "Following the Great War our economy has gone through a series of growth spurts and recessions that has created an unstable and uncertain model. The invisible hand of the free market has done little to help steer us into a desireable position in the global stage and it is becoming increasingly obvious to our greatest economists that this situation can not continue. Western writters have debated for the better part of a century how to truly break the chains of this model and achieve a truly efficient economy, and the recent experiment that is the Soviet economy and our manchurian puppet have given us a glimpse into what could be. To be independent and safe we must control the economy and adjust it to our needs."

#EVENTS

spt_jap.3.t:0 "German Production Engineers Inspect Our Methods"
spt_jap.3.desc:0 "The german engineers have concluded their inspections and have reported back to us a dreadful truth: our methods are practically ancient and full of inneficiencies compared to Western ones. This report sheds a light into our nation that is shameful. Should we really heed advice so negative and risk losing respect with our workers, or should we maintain our methods and find our own way of doing things?"
spt_jap.3.a:0 "Western advice only works in western factories, keep the japanese model!"
spt_jap.3.b:0 "How did we manage to go so long without these improvements?"

spt_jap_news.1.t:0 "The February 26th Incident"
spt_jap_news.1.d:0 "On the 26th of February a number of junior officers and soldiers under their command attempted to assassinate the vast majority of the current administration of Japan. Claiming to be doing so in an effort to bring forth a wave of reforms and societal changes that would propel the nation into a glorious future. Their attempt was thwarted when Emperor Hirohito ordered the rebels to stand down and for the army to march into Tokyo to restore order. The surviving rebels were given swift and harsh punishments, alongside members of the military and civilians suspected of harboring sympathies and having helped the radicalize the junior officers. \n If this has been a shift in the political landscape of Japan towards a less militaristic stance remains to be seen, but it is clear that the current state of affairs within the nation is unpredictable."
spt_jap_news.1.a:0 "These are dark times."
spt_jap_news.1.b:0 "There's unrest in the East."
spt_jap_news.2.t:0 "The February 26th Revolution"
spt_jap_news.2.d:0 "On the 26th of February a number of junior officers and soldiers under their command attacked key government buildings and assassinated a great amount of government officials, claiming to do so in the name of the Emperor and in service of a new beginning for Japan. Despite Emperor Hirohito protesting the actions and montioning in favor of stopping the rebelion, the Army refused to stop the insurrection, resulting in the success of the rebels.\n Now under the management of a new and radical interim government, Japan seems to be moving rapidly towards expanding its influence over East Asia. Rethoric of a new Empire and of rejection of Western influences have been a key part of this new government's speeches to foreign powers."
spt_jap_news.2.a:0 "A dark sun rises."
spt_jap_news.2.b:0 "Our victory is certain!"
spt_jap.4.t:0 "Rapid Inflation in the Grain Market"
spt_jap.4.desc:0 "Our recently conquered territories in China are not yet integrated in the Yen bloc, instead being stuck in a half-way state between the old chinese currency and ours. This has allowed for a unique situation to develop, where grain produced in Japan is more expensive in the continent, leading to sellers choosing to export it to China instead to rake huge profits. This situation can't possibly be sustainable."
spt_jap.4.a:0 "We have to find a way to solve this..."
spt_jap.5.t:0 "Solving the Grain Market Inflation"
spt_jap.5.desc:0 "It's clear to us that there are 2 solutions to this issue as it is: either we force china into the Yen bloc completely, or we let things stay as they are and seize the grain to feed our home market. Neither option will be free of consequences, but we have to address this soon."
spt_jap.5.a:0 "China isn't ready to be a full member of our market yet, seize the grain."
spt_jap.5.b:0 "Integrate their market into ours fully."
spt_jap.7.t:0 "The Toll of War"
spt_jap.7.desc:0 "It has become quite clear already that this war will require us to increase the military budget to accomodate the production of additional guns being used by our soldiers. What this means for the people is that the situation at home may be less than ideal in the short term..."
spt_jap.7.a:0 "Hopefully this is only temporary..."

SPT_JAP_support_kodoha_desc:0 "The current government of Japan is not ideal, it caves to the elites and oppresses the masses, many have attempted to destroy it in hopes that from the ashes a new nation shall rise.

SPT_JAP_marco_polo_desc:0 "[Root.GetNameDefCap] is poor in resources, but our neighbours are not. We must take from them what we lack, and only require an excuse to begin doing so.

SPT_JAP_manchu_advisors_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to control our colony it is clear that the cutthroat and highly corrupt state of manchurian politics makes them incredibly difficult to deal with, but it also is a tool to train and perfect the best fifth-collumnists we could ever hope for."

SPT_JAP_planned_eco_desc:0 "Japan's economy has been in the hands of liberals and oligarchs for far too long, the free market has failed our nation.

SPT_JAP_zaibatsu_in_gov_desc:0 "Our goal for the future of our economy is complete government control, but as of right now it is in a half-way state that is undesirable to both our politicians and our businessmen.

SPT_JAP_konoe_government_desc:0 "The japanese administration has largely been a messy affair for the last few years, swapping prime ministers at absurd rate.

SPT_JAP_anti_tank_effort_desc:0 "Our enemies have been investigating the usage of armored vehicles in their armies, it is necessary for us to study ways to counter these advancements."
SPT_JAP_anti_air_effort:0 "Anti-Air Research"
SPT_JAP_anti_air_effort_desc:0 "The power that airplanes hold on the battlefield is an entirely new dimension in warfare. We cannot hope that we will always have fighters ready to intercept enemy bombers, so it is paramount that we develop ground-based systems to fight back."
SPT_JAP_license_from_germany:0 "Request German Designs"

SPT_JAP_mechanized_effort:0 "Modern Cavalry"
SPT_JAP_mechanized_effort_desc:0 "The role of cavalry has not been diminished just because horses have become vulnerable to small arms, we simply must invent a better and stronger horse."

SPT_JAP_railway_gun_effort_desc:0 "As we study new types of artillery one thing becomes clearer with each iteration: making the gun bigger makes the damage grow alongside it. An obvious research focus then is to see what we can do if we scale our designs into gargantuan sizes."

SPT_JAP_new_weapons:0 "Streamline Weapons Manufacturing"
SPT_JAP_new_weapons_desc:0 "Japan's critical lack of steel makes it difficult to produce large quantities of weapons for our infantrymen, we must study our current designs and pinpoint inneficiencies in both power and construction."

SPT_JAP_long_lance_torpedoes:0 "Long Lance Torpedoes"
SPT_JAP_long_lance_torpedoes_desc:0 "The cruelties of global resource distribution have left our navy outnumbered by the enemy. We will therefore develop the world's most advanced torpedo, yet: a very long-range and powerful weapon, propelled by compressed oxygen rather than compressed air, that can allow our smaller surface ships to strike well above their weight."
