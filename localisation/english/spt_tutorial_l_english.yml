spt_tutorial.10.desc:0 "Welcome to the quirky little country of Denmark. While Denmark has little in the way of natural resources or manpower, it has a remarkably powerful economy through focuses/decisions and its Welfare versus Warfare Balance of Power which can be used to punch above its weight. You should aim to be on one extreme or the other.\n\nIf you play the 'historical' route of Political Unity, unlike most countries, you are expected to 'lose' to but end up collaborating with the Germans. You should build around being an Operation Barb minor like most Axis minors, although you may be able to arrange for occupation just before the North Africa campaign instead. Aim for manpower-efficient builds. After regaining independence, you can annex Norway with high collaboration and quickly fading resistance.\n\nWhen Germany invades, you must immediately surrender. Your political and military focus trees will be replaced with a collaboration focus tree, your BoP replaced by an Overlord mechanic, and Germany will take a sizeable portion of your industry. You don't immediately start in the Axis, but a couple focuses or some PP can allow you to join with your military tree back.\nIn the mod Germany does not have a major incentive to keep you puppeted. The occupation can be ended quickly and your political tree/Warfare BoP reobtained by going fascist through a couple methods:\n- Ask Germany to invade soon before King Christian X's birthday on September 26. Ask them to reject Denmark's apology and then demand your leader's resignation by decision. Elect a fascist.\n- Build up fascist support early on with the generic fascist advisor >14% before the 1939 election, and win the election with at least 25% fascist support. Take the BOP decision unlocked after 'Align with the German Reich' to convert yourself to fascism.\n- Failing all else, ask Germany to install a plenipotentiary. Kind of a bad leader and no more elections, but converts instantly.\n\nIf you play the alternate history route of Unify the Right, you go fascist and join Axis mostly on your own. This route is more suited to early game impact, with faster manpower and no disruption to the Balance of Power but weaker scaling in late-game. You will be able to annex Norway with less free collaboration."

spt_tutorial.11.desc:0 "¡Bienvenido!\nYour number one concern is NOT HAVING A CIVIL WAR!\n\n#1 The Caudillo's Civil War\n\nMexico begins with the National spirit "Caudillo Tensions Moderate". In intervals of 150 days, it will increase, in the following way:\nCaudillo Tensions Low -> Moderate -> High -> Very High -> Civil War\n\nThis threat is permanently ended by either Arresting or Supporting General Cedillo. Until you do, you can buy time by taking focuses that lower Caudillo Tensions.\n\n#2 Church Power\n\nA civil war may trigger if\n(1) your stability is less than 60%\n(2) Mexico is not Democratic government\n(3a) you have Atheist State and 'Triumph over the Cristeros'\nor (3b) you have 'Catholic State' and one of several focuses.\n\nPut simply, do not let Church Power get extreme in either direction until you are stable or democratic. If you do, quickly rectify the situation with decisions before the uprising begins."
