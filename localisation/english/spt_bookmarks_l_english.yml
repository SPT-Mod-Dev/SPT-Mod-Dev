 BRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Great Depression ruined the Brazilian economy due to over reliance on exports. The following years saw increasing levels of political upheaval as coalitions of military officers, workers and politicians overthrew the oligarchy that ruled the nation and replaced it with a fragile democratic constitution. \n\nGetúlio Vargas has come to the forefront of Brazilian politics, recently stemming a communist coup and assuming emergency powers. It remains to be seen whether democracy will be restored, or whether Vargas will take the nation in a more authoritarian direction."
SIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Left in economic ruin following the Great Depression the country fell to a coup in 1932. The colonial powers have surrounded us on the East, South and West and surely look to partition the country. War between Japan and China is surely imminent. The country needs a strong leader to see it through without falling into the clutches of some terrible fate, or worse communism. \n\nPhibun, the man for the job."
