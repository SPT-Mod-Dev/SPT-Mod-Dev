spt.18.t:0 "Drafting the Proposal"
spt.18.desc:0 "The former Qing emperor, tired of being a Japanese puppet, finally mustered up the courage to openly ask his Japanese counterpart for higher autonomy for his realm. Given the recent invasion of China by the Kwantung Army, Puyi hopes that the Japanese administration won't risk antagonizing their largest ally on the continent. Even if they reject the offer, replacing one of their only symbols of Manchu legitimacy would be a terrible idea."

spt.19.t:0 "Puyi Demands Autonomy"
spt.19.desc:0 "A proposal from our vassal state Manchukuo had arrived at the emperor's chambers yesterday evening. The former Qing emperor, Puyi, drafted a proposal suggesting higher autonomy for his realm. The most countentious demand we have received from him is the removal of the Kwantung Veto. Removing the Veto would prevent us from vetoing any reforms that the former Qing emperor might want to implement. Allowing him more autonomy could incite demands from other colonies as well. On the other hand, denying the request may spark tensions that could be problematic given our recent skirmishes in the chinese mainland. How shall the emperor respond?"

Nobusuke Kishi has been put in charge of Manhukuo, now reffered to as Manshūkoku. With the blessing of the japanese emperor by his side, his first act was the removal of the Kwantung Veto in hopes of increasing the regime's legitimacy. A ruthless man, Kishi plans on turning Manshūkoku into a model colony, by any means necessary."

spt.113.desc:0 "    Jan Smuts first served as the second Prime Minister of South Africa from 1919-1924. Defeated by Hertzog's National Party in 1924, he retired from politics for some time before returning in 1934 as deputy prime minister in a 'grand coalition' government under J. B. M. Hertzog.\n    When Hertzog advocated neutrality towards Nazi Germany in 1939, the coalition split and Hertzog's motion to remain out of the war was defeated in Parliament by a vote of 80 to 67. Governor-General Sir Patrick Duncan refused Hertzog's request to dissolve parliament for a general election on the issue. Hertzog resigned and Duncan invited Smuts, Hertzog's coalition partner, to form a government and become prime minister for the second time in order to lead the country into the Second World War on the side of the Allies.\n    Smuts's importance to the Imperial war effort was emphasised by a quite audacious plan, proposed as early as 1940, to appoint Smuts as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, should Churchill die or otherwise become incapacitated during the war. This idea was put forward by Sir John Colville, Churchill's private secretary, to Queen Mary and then to George VI, both of whom warmed to the idea.\n    One of his greatest international accomplishments was aiding in the establishment of the League of Nations, the exact design and implementation of which relied upon Smuts. He later urged the formation of a new international organisation for peace – the United Nations."
