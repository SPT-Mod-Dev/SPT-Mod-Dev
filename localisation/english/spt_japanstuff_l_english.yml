SPT_JAP_Marco_Polo_desc:0 "Since the end of the Sino-Japanese War the border between our new possessions and China has been unstable. On our side, the Tianjin Garrison seems intent on starting another conflict, and on the chinese side the nationalists are waiting for an oportunity to retake the land we rightfully conquered. It may be impossible, but we should attempt to hold back until we can normalize relations or the right time to strike at China presents itself."

spt_jap.1.t:0 "Tensions Rising in The Chinese Border"
spt_jap.1.desc:0 "The border between Manchuria and China has been a complex issue since our conquest during the Sino-Japanese War solidified our hold in mainland Asia. Per the terms of the Boxer Protocol we've been allowed to station troops at key points along the railways from Beijin to Tianjin, with minimal chinese oversight, leading to our presence being a constant thorn on their side. The army stationed there has never been easy to control and it is eager to fight another war even against the wishes of the civilian government in Tokyo. It is clear these escalations have only intensified and will require more careful maneuvering to impose our wishes on these border patrols."
spt_jap.1.a:0 "This will not end well..."
