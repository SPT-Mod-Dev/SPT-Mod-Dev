In intervals of 150 days, it will increase, in the following way:\nCaudillo Tensions Low -> Moderate -> High -> Very High -> Civil War\n\nThis threat is permanently ended by either Arresting or Supporting General Cedillo. Until you do, you can buy time by taking focuses that lower Caudillo Tensions.\n\n#2 Church Power\n\nA civil war may trigger if\n(1) your stability is less than 60%\n(2) Mexico is not Democratic government\n(3a) you have Atheist State and 'Triumph over the Cristeros'\nor (3b) you have 'Catholic State' and one of several focuses.\n\nPut simply, do not let Church Power get extreme in either direction until you are stable or democratic. If you do, quickly rectify the situation with decisions before the uprising begins."
