spt.18.t:0 "Drafting the Proposal"
spt.18.desc:0 "The former Qing emperor, tired of being a Japanese puppet, finally mustered up the courage to openly ask his Japanese counterpart for higher autonomy for his realm. Given the recent invasion of China by the Kwantung Army, Puyi hopes that the Japanese administration won't risk antagonizing their largest ally on the continent. Even if they reject the offer, replacing one of their only symbols of Manchu legitimacy would be a terrible idea."

spt.19.t:0 "Puyi Demands Autonomy"
spt.19.desc:0 "A proposal from our vassal state Manchukuo had arrived at the emperor's chambers yesterday evening. The former Qing emperor, Puyi, drafted a proposal suggesting higher autonomy for his realm. The most countentious demand we have received from him is the removal of the Kwantung Veto. Removing the Veto would prevent us from vetoing any reforms that the former Qing emperor might want to implement. Allowing him more autonomy could incite demands from other colonies as well. On the other hand, denying the request may spark tensions that could be problematic given our recent skirmishes in the chinese mainland. How shall the emperor respond?"

Nobusuke Kishi has been put in charge of Manhukuo, now reffered to as Manshūkoku. With the blessing of the japanese emperor by his side, his first act was the removal of the Kwantung Veto in hopes of increasing the regime's legitimacy. A ruthless man, Kishi plans on turning Manshūkoku into a model colony, by any means necessary."
spt.21.a:0 "The terror begins."


spt.22.t:0 "Puyi's Wild Request"
spt.22.desc:0 "Despite being given most of China, the Qing emperor still considers the process of unification incomplete. We've received a message today requesting the handover of East Hebei and Dalian, our last directly controlled portions of the chinese mainland. The Qing emperor promises great prosperity between our two peoples if the request is met. We have already given our puppet great autonomy and this act may be seen by the public as a loss of control and a betrayal of japanese interests. With the cabinet split into two over the decision, it is up to the Showa emperor to cast the tiebraker."
spt.22.a:0 "It's time to recognize them as equals."
spt.22.b:0 "Puyi forgets his place."
