#DECISIONS

SPT_JAP_eco_pressure:0 "Growing Economic Bubble"
SPT_JAP_eco_pressure_desc:0 "Following the Great War our economy has gone through a series of growth spurts and recessions that has created an unstable and uncertain model. The invisible hand of the free market has done little to help steer us into a desireable position in the global stage and it is becoming increasingly obvious to our greatest economists that this situation can not continue. Western writters have debated for the better part of a century how to truly break the chains of this model and achieve a truly efficient economy, and the recent experiment that is the Soviet economy and our manchurian puppet have given us a glimpse into what could be. To be independent and safe we must control the economy and adjust it to our needs."

#EVENTS

spt_jap.3.t:0 "German Production Engineers Inspect Our Methods"
spt_jap.3.desc:0 "The german engineers have concluded their inspections and have reported back to us a dreadful truth: our methods are practically ancient and full of inneficiencies compared to Western ones. This report sheds a light into our nation that is shameful. Should we really heed advice so negative and risk losing respect with our workers, or should we maintain our methods and find our own way of doing things?"
spt_jap.3.a:0 "Western advice only works in western factories, keep the japanese model!"
spt_jap.3.b:0 "How did we manage to go so long without these improvements?"

spt_jap_news.1.t:0 "The February 26th Incident"
spt_jap_news.1.d:0 "On the 26th of February a number of junior officers and soldiers under their command attempted to assassinate the vast majority of the current administration of Japan. Claiming to be doing so in an effort to bring forth a wave of reforms and societal changes that would propel the nation into a glorious future. Their attempt was thwarted when Emperor Hirohito ordered the rebels to stand down and for the army to march into Tokyo to restore order. The surviving rebels were given swift and harsh punishments, alongside members of the military and civilians suspected of harboring sympathies and having helped the radicalize the junior officers. \n If this has been a shift in the political landscape of Japan towards a less militaristic stance remains to be seen, but it is clear that the current state of affairs within the nation is unpredictable."
spt_jap_news.1.a:0 "These are dark times."
spt_jap_news.1.b:0 "There's unrest in the East."
spt_jap_news.1.c:0 "We must end this wave of terrorism..."
spt_jap_news.2.t:0 "The February 26th Revolution"
spt_jap_news.2.d:0 "On the 26th of February a number of junior officers and soldiers under their command attacked key government buildings and assassinated a great amount of government officials, claiming to do so in the name of the Emperor and in service of a new beginning for Japan. Despite Emperor Hirohito protesting the actions and montioning in favor of stopping the rebelion, the Army refused to stop the insurrection, resulting in the success of the rebels.\n Now under the management of a new and radical interim government, Japan seems to be moving rapidly towards expanding its influence over East Asia. Rethoric of a new Empire and of rejection of Western influences have been a key part of this new government's speeches to foreign powers."
spt_jap_news.2.a:0 "A dark sun rises."
spt_jap_news.2.b:0 "We have a new ally in the Pacific!"
spt_jap_news.2.c:0 "Our victory is certain!"

spt_jap_news.3.b:0 "The first hellrider comes!"
spt_jap_news.3.c:0 "The wheel of Dharma is running out of time..."
spt_jap_news.3.d:0 "This morning a declaration of war has been issued by Japan, targetting the USA and the Allies. This declaration cites the West's colonial presence in Asia as one of the major reasons for war, mentioning that the continent should not be ruled by far-away from itself. It remains to be seen if this is the true intentions behind Japan's words or if it is an attempt at forging an Empire for itself, but what is certain right now is that the seriousness of this matter cannot be understated."
spt_jap.4.t:0 "Rapid Inflation in the Grain Market"
spt_jap.4.desc:0 "Our recently conquered territories in China are not yet integrated in the Yen bloc, instead being stuck in a half-way state between the old chinese currency and ours. This has allowed for a unique situation to develop, where grain produced in Japan is more expensive in the continent, leading to sellers choosing to export it to China instead to rake huge profits. This situation can't possibly be sustainable."
spt_jap.4.a:0 "We have to find a way to solve this..."
spt_jap.5.t:0 "Solving the Grain Market Inflation"
spt_jap.5.desc:0 "It's clear to us that there are 2 solutions to this issue as it is: either we force china into the Yen bloc completely, or we let things stay as they are and seize the grain to feed our home market. Neither option will be free of consequences, but we have to address this soon."
spt_jap.5.a:0 "China isn't ready to be a full member of our market yet, seize the grain."
spt_jap.5.b:0 "Integrate their market into ours fully."
spt_jap.7.t:0 "The Toll of War"
spt_jap.7.desc:0 "It has become quite clear already that this war will require us to increase the military budget to accomodate the production of additional guns being used by our soldiers. What this means for the people is that the situation at home may be less than ideal in the short term..."
spt_jap.7.a:0 "Hopefully this is only temporary..."
spt_jap.8.t:0 "Japan Prepares To Take Hong Kong"
spt_jap.8.desc:0 "For a few years now the Japanese have been more and more aggressive in their diplomacy towards us, indicating a displeasure with our presence in Asia. Today, reports from our officials stationed in Hong Kong have been delivered indicating a number of japanese army movements towards the city, it seems that they intend on seeing how far they can get with their conquest of China."
spt_jap.8.a:0 "We must defend it!"
spt_jap.8.b:0 "Give up, let them have it."
spt_jap.9.t:0 "A Japanese Win In Hong Kong"
spt_jap.9.desc:0 "Japanese forces have managed to secure a victory in Hong Kong, taking over the city and immediately ordering that all English citizens leave it within the next 48 hours."
spt_jap.9.a:0 "This is just the beggining..."
spt_jap.9.b:0 "Another western stronghold defeated!"
spt_jap.10.t:0 "An English Win In Hong Kong"

spt_jap.10.b:0 "What a shameful display of our military prowess."
spt_jap.11.t:0 "Stalemate In Hong Kong"
spt_jap.11.desc:0 "Despite the long battle that occured in Hong Kong, neither side could take a decisive victory, with hostilities being exhausted and both nations agreeing to let this go in view of current events elsewhere."
spt_jap.11.a:0 "What a waste of our time..."
spt_jap_news.4.t:0 "Japan Seizes Control Of Hong Kong"
spt_jap_news.4.d:0 "For the last few years japanese diplomacy has been steadly trending towards a staunch anti-West attidude, with hostilities towards Great Britain increasing enormously after the signing of the updated London Naval Treaty and the breaking off of their alliance with Japan. These hostilities only intensified with Great Britain's concerns over Japan starting yet another conflict in China, which they believed was in violation of several international agreements regarding the sovereignty and free trade within the chinese territory. Earlier this week Japan proclaimed that it would no longer allow westerners to have a presence in China and initiated an attack against british forces stationed in Hong Kong. The battle was fierce and resulted in many civilian casualties, culminating in a Japanese victory."
spt_jap_news.4.a:0 "This is getting dangerous..."
spt_jap_news.4.b:0 "Another display of weekness from the Allies!"
spt_jap_news.4.c:0 "Asia belongs to us!"
spt_jap.12.t:0 "Japanese Forces Intesifying"
spt_jap.12.desc:0 "Our spies in Japan indicate that an large scale offensive is coming, larger than the usual battles we've been fighting recently."
spt_jap.12.a:0 "Prepare for the worst!"
spt_jap.13.t:0 "Pacific War Causes Economic Isolation"
spt_jap.13.desc:0 "We were aware that the war against the United States would limit our trade routes and practically lock us to only trading with those under our bloc. What we didn't expect was how fast this would end up causing our economic situation to worsen..."
spt_jap.13.a:0 "The only way forward is through conquest now..."
